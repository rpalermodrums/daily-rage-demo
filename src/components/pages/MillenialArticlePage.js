              <p>NEW JERSEY—Over a month after the election of Donald Trump, 24-year- old Nicole

                 Schrachter refuses to accept the result, choosing instead to shelter herself from, as she puts it, “a

                 pretty obvious bigot.”</p>

              <p><blockquote>"Everything he wanted to do was either impractical or racist, or both. I mean, he wanted to ban an entire religion from the country.”</blockquote></p>


              <p>“I get that he won, I mean I respect the democratic process or whatever. I just kind of had faith

                 that people didn&#39;t suck as much as I thought they did,” Nicole said when we interviewed her in

                 the three-foot closet she uses as a bedroom. “I just…like…wanted a president that wasn’t a racist

                 demagogue, or a vice president that didn’t approve of electro-shocking gay people. Also, why

                 are you in my apartment?”</p>

              <p>Nicole’s father, Allan, was more level-headed. He supported Donald Trump in the election and

                 considers the election a healthy wake-up call for his daughter.</p>

              <p>
                “Nicole has been handed everything in life,” Allan said. “She’s always complaining about the

                job market, but she’s working three cushy minimum-wage jobs! When Trump won, it was the

                first time Nicole didn’t get what she wanted.&quot;
              </p>

              <p>When asked why she supported Hillary Clinton, Nicole dodged the question.</p>

              <p>“No, I’m serious, why are you in my apartment?” she said, clearly uncomfortable being asked to

                 defend Clinton’s crimes.</p>

              <p>We checked in with Nicole’s father at his home, which he bought at 25 years old using the

                 savings from working at Dairy Queen during the summers.</p>

              <p>“Nicole doesn’t like Trump because she doesn’t understand the struggles of working class

                 people. She’s always throwing away her money on frivolous things like paying back her student

                 loans!” Allan said.</p>

              <p>For her part, Nicole could not provide a specific reason for opposing the president-elect.</p>

              <p>“Everything he wanted to do was either impractical or racist, or both. I mean, he wanted to ban

                 an entire religion from the country. Did we just forget about that? Wait, no, I’m not answering

                 any more questions. Get out of my apartment or I’m calling the police.”</p>

              <p>Why Nicole was so defensive remains to be seen. What is clear is that Nicole, like other

                 millennials, will never appreciate the sacrifices their parents have made in shaping the America

                 they live in: one in which Donald Trump will be the President of the United States.</p>
