              <p>Nobody has suffered more from the dissolution of gender norms than American women. This cultural

                 shift has upset a critical balance within our society and forced females into unnatural roles. No matter

                 what feminists tell you, every woman wants to do the same three things: cook, clean, and die during

                 childbirth.</p>

              <p>Believe me, I love women. That’s why I’m so passionate about ensuring they meet untimely, preventable

                 deaths. Whenever I see a stressed out female CEO, I think about how much happier she would be with

                 undiagnosed eclampsia and internal hemorrhaging. It&#39;s common knowledge that a woman’s soft,

                 osteoporotic bones aren’t meant for working an office job. No, women should stay home and enjoy the

                 simple comforts of bleeding out when their baby is in breech.</p>

              <p>It’s time to embrace the fact that men and women have separate biology. After all, society only finds

                 harmony when men act like men and women act like women. God created the sexes as two halves of a

                 whole. There is no better way for women to honor this divine feminine gift than having a life expectancy

                 of 34.</p>

              <p>
                Think for a moment. Imagine the America of your great-grandparents. The wonder of a friendly

                suburban neighborhood, local innovation on every street corner. Your great-grandmother, nine months

                pregnant, preparing a fresh plate of eggs and bacon for her beloved. Your great-grandfather kissing her

                on the cheek and heading to his job at the automotive factory. He is attaching the wheel to a Model T

                when he receives a telegram that his wife is in labor. He wipes the sweat off his brow and smiles to

                himself. He is a proud, hard-working American. Your great-grandmother dies within the hour from a

                cervical tear.
              </p>

              <p>This is the America we must return to.</p>
