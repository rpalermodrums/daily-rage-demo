              <p>President Donald Trump made headlines following a rally yesterday when a reporter asked him if he

                 supported white nationalism. Trump initially denied subscribing to the ideology before learning what it

                 was, at which point he changed his position.</p>

              <p>“No I am not a white nationalist. I’ve never heard of white nationalism. What does that even mean?”

                 Trump said.</p>

              <p>The reporter then explained white nationalism as the belief that national identity should be built around

                 white ethnicity, and that white people should therefore maintain both a demographic majority and

                 dominance of the nation’s culture and public life.</p>

              <p>
                “Oh, never mind then. I’m totally in favor of that. In fact that sounds like pretty much the entire point of

                my presidency,” the president replied. “It’s about reasserting white dominance in an increasingly diverse

                nation. What did you think I meant by ‘Make America Great Again?’ I thought I was making myself pretty

                clear.”
              </p>

              <p>While some of Trump’s supporters took issue with his statements, most saw it as refreshingly honest.

                 Mark Calloway, a Trump supporter who attended the rally, was surprised that it was even a question

                 worth asking.</p>

              <p>“I mean, yeah. He’s a white nationalist. It’s a white nationalist agenda. That’s…did anyone not get that?”

                 Calloway said.</p>

              <p>House Speaker Paul Ryan was quick to disavow the comments, stating “The Republican Party is not a

                 white nationalist party.” When asked if he still stood behind Trump, Ryan quickly responded,

                 “Absolutely.”</p>
