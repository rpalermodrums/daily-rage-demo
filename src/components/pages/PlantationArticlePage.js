              <p>President-elect Donald Trump today announced a bold new job-creation initiative that would

                 mandate individuals to work for free on Southern cotton plantations.</p>

              <p><blockquote>“This plan will do wonders for the African-American community”</blockquote></p>


              <p>In a press conference held in front of Trump Tower, the president-elect told reporters that the

                 jobs program would be targeted toward African-Americans.</p>

              <p>“We used to pick so much cotton in this country,” said the president-elect. “Great, American

                 cotton. I promise to bring those jobs back.”</p>

              <p>
                The announcement was a special moment for Trump’s nominee for attorney-general, Alabama

                Senator Jeff Sessions, who has been working on a similar plan for decades.
              </p>

              <p>“This plan will do wonders for the African-American community,” Sessions stated in an

                 interview, noting that the cotton-picking industry had, at one point, reduced America’s black

                 unemployment rate to zero percent.</p>

              <p>Trump focused on the plan’s benefits for workers, including food and accommodation which

                 would be provided by benevolent plantation administrators. He also signaled the potential for

                 workers to advance in the ranks, promising that the “good, clean ones will be allowed to work in

                 the house.”</p>

              <p>Asked whether the jobs program was a form of modern-day slavery, Trump clarified that it

                 wasn’t.</p>

              <p>“It’s very different from slavery, very different,” Trump stated. “Besides, there are so many

                 problems in the black community right now. Maybe slavery wouldn’t be so bad. I mean, what

                 the hell do they have to lose?”</p>
