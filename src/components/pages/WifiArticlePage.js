              <p>Every day I see more and more evidence that today&#39;s crop of young people is the worst this country has

                 ever seen. Political correctness and so-called “safe spaces” have turned this generation into a crop of

                 sensitive, coddled, over-protected numbskulls. It’s hard to see how they can survive in the modern

                 world, which can be a complicated and difficult place.</p>

              <p>(On a quick sidenote, I’m having trouble connecting to the internet right now. Can somebody give me a

                 hand?)</p>

              <p>I was a college student during the Vietnam War. Many of my peers burned their draft cards and got

                 arrested at protests—I didn’t, I was too busy working part-time at my dad’s accounting firm—but it was

                 a tumultuous time, filled with civil unrest. That struggle hardened my generation in ways that the

                 millennial generation, which grew up in a time defined by constant paranoia over terrorist attacks and

                 school shootings, could never understand.</p>

              <p>
                (Not to dwell on the subject, but I’m really in a bind here. I double-clicked on Internet Explorer several

                times but I keep getting a message that says “This page cannot be displayed.” I haven’t been able to

                check my email for a week. I would usually ask my grandson for help but he asked me to stop calling him

                every day for computer advice. Maybe I should just call him. I don’t know what to do. This stuff makes

                no sense. It’s ridiculous. They should really make these things easier to understand. I’ll send him a text.

                He usually responds to my texts.)
              </p>

              <p>The point is, millennials are too soft for the real world. They’re treated like special little snowflakes from

                 the time they’re born and so it’s no wonder they can’t do anything!</p>

              <p>(Oh good, my grandson texted me back. He said “Unplug your router and plug it back in again.” I don’t

                 know what that means. This is a mess. Just a mess.)</p>

              <p>I sincerely hope the millennial generation gets itself together. But I won&#39;t cross my...</p>
