              <p>MEXICO CITY, MEXICO—President Donald Trump has delivered on a long-standing promise of his

                 campaign today, as Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto has agreed to send one of his unpaid interns

                 to work on Trump’s border wall.</p>

              <p>Trump announced this victory at a press conference 1,851 miles outside of Mexico City at his resort in

                 Mar-a- Lago.</p>

              <p>“I have been saying all along that Mexico will pay the full $25 billion cost of the wall. Well, today I got

                 something even better. Today, I got Brian.”</p>

              <p>
                The intern, Brian Shelby, is a well-respected self-starter with impressive proficiency in Microsoft Office.

                He hopes to contribute to the border wall by providing his renowned administrative assistance and

                customer service skills. This is a win for the Trump campaign by any stretch of the imagination.
              </p>

              <p>
                For his part, Nieto has stated that Brian was difficult to part with, but Trump drove a hard bargain.
              </p>


              <p>“I don’t really care about losing Brian. He was okay. Kind of incompetent actually. Like, you would ask

                 him to do something and he would ask so many questions that eventually you would just give up and do

                 it yourself,” the Mexican president stated in an interview.</p>

              <p>While liberals have been quick to criticize this as a failure, many conservatives have praised the deal.

                 Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was ecstatic when asked about Brian.</p>

              <p>“I tell you something, Brian is a real game-changer for our national security,” Giuliani said. “If Brian had

                 been around fifteen years ago, the September 11th attacks would not have happened. That’s a fact.”</p>

              <p>Brian himself seemed very enthusiastic when asked about his new position.</p>

              <p>“This isn’t what I signed up for. I’m not doing it. I swear to God,” Brian said. “I will quit. I don’t care. I will

                 quit.”</p>
