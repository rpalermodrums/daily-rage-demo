              <p>One of the most refreshing things about the Trump Administration has been the infusion of business

                 principles into the public sector. Waste, fraud, and abuse have run rampant in the government for too

                 long. Donald Trump is proving what conservatives have been saying for years: Government must be run

                 like a business, and that business is GameStop.</p>

              <p><blockquote>“If the government ran like GameStop, we could pay Eric minimum wage to manage our nuclear stockpile.”</blockquote></p>


              <p>When I walk into the GameStop at the Rockaway Mall, I am struck by the efficiency with which the store

                 operates. They have only one employee, a young man by the name of Eric. Eric is the manager, clerk,

                 and infrequent janitor of the store. Does Eric burp frequently and openly view pornography while on the

                 job? Yes, but he gets the job done.</p>

              <p>Compare that to the Department of Energy, which employs nearly 100,000 people for the purpose of

                 regulating domestic energy production, directing genomic research, disposing radioactive waste, and

                 overseeing the nuclear weapons program. That’s right: the government needs thousands of employees

                 just to perform those simple, uncomplicated tasks! If the government ran like GameStop, we could pay

                 Eric minimum wage to manage our nuclear stockpile. And you know what? I think he’d do a fine job.</p>

              <p>
                GameStop also has a wonderful trade-in policy whereby customers can trade in used video games in

                exchange for store credit. I believe this principle can be applied to our education system. If you don’t

                like your public school, you should be allowed to trade in your used video games in exchange for tuition

                at a private school.
              </p>

              <p>We are moving in the right direction, but we could move faster. The way forward has been made clear

                 by the luminaries at GameStop. Their business is thriving. We need only follow their lead for our

                 government, and our country, to thrive as well.</p>

              <p><i>*Update: Since the initial writing of this article, GameStop’s stocks have fallen drastically due to

                    competition from the online gaming market. The company announced it intends to close 150 stores in

                    2017. Still, I think the metaphor tracks.</i></p>
